# NYT Article HTML/CSS copy

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements?ref=lnav) curriculum, replicating the basic HTML and CSS of an NYT article

## Things I learned
* More practice with HTML and CSS
* How to use Font Awesome Icons
* Positioning text on top of Font Awesome Icons using stacks

## Things to work on
* No favicon
* I'm sure my choice of classes/ids/CSS selectors is a bit of a mess
* 'Theory of Inflation' grid section should probably use padding instead of empty rows to make sure the background image isn't covered
